## Why?

I want to have quick access to podcasts in my phone. But I cannot use/don't care about using an app.

## Build your own!

It should be possible to host your own podcast feed. Just fork and change `feeds.json` with the feeds that YOU want to keep track of. Of course you can also PR if you found a really an interesting podcast I should keep track of (preferably but not limited to tech related stuff).
